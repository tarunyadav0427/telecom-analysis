Wavecon Post 5G Implementation Presentation

Problem Statement:

As part of Codebasics' internship program, I was tasked with creating a PowerPoint presentation focusing on the impact of 5G implementation on various key aspects at Wavecon Ltd. The presentation comprises three slides, delving into crucial points related to the adoption of 5G.

Key Points:

1. Impact of 5G Launch on Revenue:
 -- This slide examines the overall impact on revenue and delves into the revenue fluctuations on a city-wise basis.
 -- Diagrams are utilized to illustrate the cities experiencing positive growth post-5G expansion and those facing a decline in revenue.

2. Underperforming KPIs After 5G Launch:
 -- The presentation explores three key performance indicators (KPIs) in Wavecon's model:
 Average Revenue Per User (ARU)
 Total Active Users (TAU)
 Total Unsubscribed Users (TUU)
 -- Using the provided dashboard, a comparison of revenue changes among the three KPIs is presented. The slide highlights TAU, which experienced the most significant revenue decrease, covering:
 Percentage reduction in active users
 Reasons for the substantial reduction
 Citywise analysis of active user changes since 5G implementation.

3. Performance of Plans and Its Suggestions:
 -- This slide conducts a comparative study of different mobile plans, categorized into:
 Plans with increasing revenues
 Plans causing losses
 Stable plans maintaining consistent revenue post-5G expansion.
 -- It identifies the plan with a notable revenue decrease and suggests discontinuation, providing reasoning for the decision.# telecom-analysis
